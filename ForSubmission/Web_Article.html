        <p>In <em>computing</em>, source code is any collection of code, with or without comments,
        written using a human-readable programming language, usually as <strong>plain text</strong>.
        The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers,
        who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code.</p>

        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
        </p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
            It is a special kind of <strong>text document</strong>that is used by Web browsers to present text and graphics.
            The text includes markup tags such as to indicate the start of a paragraph, and to indicate
            the end of a paragraph. HTML documents are often refered to as "Web pages".
        </p>
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>

        <p>

        web. Here are 5 of them:
